echo.
echo pcb = pre-programmed command based
echo.
echo pcb_ai is an ai-styled program written in cmd/batch.
echo this "ai" is not based on any api, because of the
echo limitations of things in the batch scripting language.
echo.
echo but i, stryknine, managed to do something creative with
echo a batch file, even though it probably doesnt support api's.
echo.
echo rules:
echo 1. pcb won't understand sexual topics.
echo 2. pcb won't teach you how to commit crimes.
echo 3. for each word in every sentence, use underlines.
echo 4. type everything in lowercase.
